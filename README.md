# Games Club

The Games Club Website was designed in line with Portfolio Project 1's guidelines and aimed at people looking to join a club of likeminded people looking to play competitive and co-operative games for fun, or to join competitive tournaments to play for prizes.

The Users of this website, the target being people who are enthusiastic about video games, or simply just want to relax with friends, will be provided with all the information they need on both meetups to play games and tournaments alike, as well as how to sign up, and where they can find more information such as social media sites like Facebook or Twitter.
