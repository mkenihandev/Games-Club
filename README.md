# Games Club

The Games Club Website was designed in line with Portfolio Project 1's guidelines and aimed at people looking to join a club of likeminded people looking to play competitive and co-operative games for fun, or to join competitive tournaments to play for prizes.

The Users of this website, the target being people who are enthusiastic about video games, or simply just want to relax with friends, will be provided with all the information they need on both meetups to play games and tournaments alike, as well as how to sign up, and where they can find more information such as social media sites like Facebook or Twitter.

## Initial UX Goals and Designs
<hr>

To begin with, I had drawn up a simple layout of what I imagined the site to look like, as well as detailed descriptions of how I would want each page to function for the user.

![3 images showing basic Home, Tournaments and Sign Up pages layout. Games Club heading, underneath writes: A place for gaming meetups and torunaments. Provides user with info about the club, meetup times, types of games played. Tournament page details where, when and games being played as well as bracket.](/assets/images/page1.jpg)

![More details for website, it reads: Sign up page is just for the club, seperate sign up sheet on tournaments page. Sign up includes your preferred platform between PC, Xbox, Playstation or Switch, to better your understanding with other members. In brackets reads "Maybe include a members page in future versions of site?". Social Media links in footer provide users with other methods of finding information about the club, in brackets: "Facebook page posts pics of events, twitter posts meetup times for example". Header always the same as to not confuse the user.](assets/images/page2.jpg)
