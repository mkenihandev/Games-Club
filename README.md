# Games Club

The Games Club Website was designed in line with Portfolio Project 1's guidelines and aimed at people looking to join a club of likeminded people looking to play competitive and co-operative games for fun, or to join competitive tournaments to play for prizes.

The Users of this website, the target being people who are enthusiastic about video games, or simply just want to relax with friends, will be provided with all the information they need on both meetups to play games and tournaments alike, as well as how to sign up, and where they can find more information such as social media sites like Facebook or Twitter.

## Initial UX Goals and Designs
<hr>

To begin with, I had drawn up a simple layout of what I imagined the site to look like, as well as detailed descriptions of how I would want each page to function for the user.

![3 images showing basic Home, Tournaments and Sign Up pages layout. Games Club heading, underneath writes: A place for gaming meetups and torunaments. Provides user with info about the club, meetup times, types of games played. Tournament page details where, when and games being played as well as bracket.](/assets/images/readme-images/page1.jpg)

![More details for website, it reads: Sign up page is just for the club, seperate sign up sheet on tournaments page. Sign up includes your preferred platform between PC, Xbox, Playstation or Switch, to better your understanding with other members. In brackets reads "Maybe include a members page in future versions of site?". Social Media links in footer provide users with other methods of finding information about the club, in brackets: "Facebook page posts pics of events, twitter posts meetup times for example". Header always the same as to not confuse the user.](assets/images/readme-images/page2.jpg)

The goal of these sketches and details was to get a rough outline of what a user interested in a Games Club would be looking for, between what the Club actually does, to what times they actually meet up. The basic sketches provided a very simple way to lay the foundations of how I would want the website to look. In particular I wanted this website to look fun and welcoming first and foremost as to reel in anyone interested but also provide an easy, readable experience for any user who is unsure as they don't need difficult website navigation weighing on top of everything else.

## Features of the Website
<hr>

**This website was designed with a mobile-first approach, and as such the images below were taken in a mobile viewport size, the website will still function and change on desktop, however.**

* **Navigation Bar** 
    * The navigation bar displays an icon that the user will become familiar with through the entire site, representing The Games Club logo.
    * The nav-bar features three concise links that bring users to different pages of the site, dedicated to different aspects of the Club.
    * The nav-bar has styling when hovered over to clearly tell the user what link they would be clicking.
    * The nav-bar is in a readable font and color against its background, so the user can clearly see it when they need it.

* **The Header**
    * The header features a hero image and about us section in one so the user is immediately greeted with what the Club is about.
    * The About Us section clearly tells the user what the Club is for, and explains that meetup times will be displayed below so the user knows to scroll.
    * This section also features a link to the tournaments page directly, in case the user would like to sign up immediately after reading about it.
